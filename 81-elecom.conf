# Quick reference. This file is responsible for button mappings; my i3 config
# is responsible for converting some of the buttons into keystrokes.
#
# Each button's physical number is given in parentheses; the ButtonMapping
# below maps from that space onto the actual button numbers generated by the
# driver.

# It would be nice to also be able to map the wheel rotation and side clicks to
# keystrokes, but the driver generates the same button events for those actions
# as for scrolling with the ball. So if I try to bind the wheel clicks to keys,
# those keys will also be pressed when I scroll with the ball.
