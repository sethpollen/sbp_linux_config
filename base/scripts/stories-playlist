# Takes as input a bunch of .zip files from my "Stories Podcast" Google
# Drive folder. Sorts their contents and intersperses periods of silence. The
# result is a set of files suitable for copying to a cheap MP3 player.
#
# How to use:
#
#   1) rm -rf ~/Downloads/*
#
#   2) Open
#      https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1dNEzZIY6VpBqcZn2zX1zVXho6N97ILbO
#      in a browser.
#
#   3) Right-click on "Episodes" in the top breadcrumb bar. Click "Download".
#      Wait for all the downloads to complete.
#
#   4) cd ~/Downloads && stories-playlist *.zip
#
#   5) "~/Downloads/Playlists" now contains a flat set of files which can be
#      copied to the MP3 player.

# Extract the .zip files. This will produce files under ~/Downloads/Episodes.
