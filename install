#!/bin/sh
# This script provides a standard installation of sbp-linux-config through
# the following steps:
#   1. It copies everything from ./src to ./bin.
#   2. It makes several symlinks in standard places (such as ~) that point
#      to the appropriate files in ./bin.
#   3. If arguments are provided, each is interpreted as a directory which
#      may contain zero or more subdirectories corresponding to the
#      subdirectories of ./src. Each file in each of these directires is
#      read in and appended to the corresponding file in ./bin. If no such
#      file exists yet in ./bin, it is created with the appended contents.
#      This provides a simple mechanism for adding per-machine customizations.
