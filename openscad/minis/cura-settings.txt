Start with "Normal Quality - 0.16mm".

Set Build Plate Adhesion Type to "none" to disable brims and skirts.

For most models, 20% fill is enough.

For dice, use 80% fill to give them a nice heft.

For the piece box, use 50% "cubic" fill. The "Fine Quality - 0.2mm" is fine.
For the piece box lid, use 40% "cubic" fill.
