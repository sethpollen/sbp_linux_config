Start with "Normal Quality - 0.16mm".

Brims, skirts, and rafts are not necessary unless there are supports. Supports
probably need a raft under them.

For most models, 20% fill is enough.

For dice, use 80% fill to give them a nice heft.

For the piece box and lid, use 40% "cubic" fill and "Fine Quality - 0.2mm".
