The installer framework could use an overhaul. A few specific bugs:

1) A failure to copy over binaries does not prevent install.sh from printing
   "success" at the end. It's not a huge detail because there is an error
   message right above "success," but it's still annoying.

2) There is a lot of vestigial stuff in there to support laptop vs. desktop
   installations. Probably not needed, as soon I will not be making any attempt
   to run i3 (or any other Linux desktop) on a laptop of any kind. Hopefully
   we can settle on a single DPI setting for everyone.

3) It would probably be better to write it all in Go.
