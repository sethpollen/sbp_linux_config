TODO: Try to move more stuff out of Google docs and into the version controlled
installer scripts. And maybe fold in install-desktop. Ideally all we need to
do on a fresh machine is copy-paste one command like this:
  curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sethpollen/sbp_linux_config/master/one-time-install.sh | bash

TODO: fix Ctrl+Shift+I shortcut in kate so it invokes the GoFmt tool. This
mapping gets stored in an XML file somewhere under $HOME with "external" and
"ui" in the path.
